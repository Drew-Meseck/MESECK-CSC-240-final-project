Alpha Pseudocode

Setup:
	Port A to output
	Port B to input
	Set-up ADC Interrupts
	Set-up Timer Interrupts
	
	Initialize piece arrays in memory //these contain all the initial pieces
					  //by some offset and arrays for their rotations
					  //this will allow for spawning new pieces
					  //and rotating them by pointing to different
					  //offsets and positions in the array

	Initialize macros to reference 4x4 page piece space.

Title Screen:
	Write title Screen Data
	When Timer Interrupt is called refresh Screen
	

Game:
	Spawn a Piece
	delay 1s
	Try to move piece down screen
	if can:
		move piece down one space
	if cannot: 
		lock piece into place
		if complete line:
			clear line
			move all above lines down
		else:
			do nothing
		spawn new piece at new potentiometer input location

	if ADC interrupt:
		take adc result
		set x position of piece box to a division of the adc result
		if piece segment hits edge of screen:
			stop the translation
			//empty columns of the 4x4 piece reference can go off the screen
			//lit boxes that makeup the piece cannot
		else:
			continue
	
	if rotate button pressed:
		if counter > 4:
			set pointer to initial piece offset
		if counter <= 4:
			increment piece pointer to next rotation array		
			
	If timer interrupt:
		refresh and write the new piece positions to the screen
