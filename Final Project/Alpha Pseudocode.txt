Alpha Pseudocode

Setup:
	Port A to output
	Port B to input
	Set-up ADC Interrupts
	Set-up Timer Interrupts

Title Screen:
	Write title Screen Data
	When Timer Interrupt is called refresh Screen
	Port B interrupt starts the game.
	

Game:
	Randomly Spawn New Projectile at top (maybe not always)
	Move all projectiles down
	if Projectile is at y of 1 and Sheild is at same x:
		increment score counter
		check win condition
		clear projectile
	if Projectile is at y of 0:
		increment loss counter
		check lose condition
		clear projectile
	loop Game 

	
	if ADC interrupt:
		take adc result
		use ROL to find the MSB of adc(low) result and store that in a counter
		assign that counter value to the x position of the first of the two blocks
		clear bottom row
		write new shield using new x position
		return from interrupt
			
			
	If timer interrupt:(60Hz)
		refresh and write the new positions of objects to the screen
		return from interrupt
